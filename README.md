# Race_Simulation_1
 A simple simulation of a motor race with Python

The purpose of this project is to develop a simulation of a motor race. The simulation models a single car and allows for tyre wear and fuel load.

The objective of the simualation is to determine the optimal lap for a competitor in a motor race to stop for a pit-stop.
